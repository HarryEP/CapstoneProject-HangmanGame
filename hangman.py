'''
The plan is to either import a set of words or have a list of 50/100 words to choose from at random.
Then we will implement the game of hangman, using a system of lives for each wrong guess and showing all wrong guesses throughout
while continuining to display the word so far.
Then we can repeat this, and have a score for how many times the word is guessed vs not guessed.
Also, we will make sure not to repeat words.
